# EcoBUILDApp
The app EcoBuild allows a user to document sightings of endangered species, as well as view official sightings of endangered species all to bring awareness
of one's environment and our impact on the species within it. 
We hope to inspire users to act on this cause: whether it’s calling lawmakers to implement protective laws, 
or just alerting others to be more cautious about their impact on species’ habitats.

Opening the app brings a welcome screen, with a brief description. A link to official sightings is provided, along with a start button. 
Upon clicking the button, users are given a map where they can pinpoint a sighting of an endangered species, by clicking a plus sign.
When going back to the screen and clicking the link to official sightings, a government website from 
Massachusetts is shown, listing all documented observations. 
It is encouraged to explore the link, searching by towns or names of species.
